HACKING
=======

1) you can modify the generated code as with any other PHP extension


BUILDING ON *NIX
================

To compile your new extension, you will have to execute the following steps
(assuming you cloned repo to ~/php-couchdb):

1.  $ cd ~/php-couchdb
2.  $ phpize
3.  $ ./configure
4.  $ make
5.  $ make test
6.  $ strip modules/couchdb.so
7.  $ [sudo] make install


BUILDING ON WINDOWS
===================

No windows build is available at the moment


TESTING
=======

You can now load the extension using a php.ini directive

  extension="couchdb.so"

or load it at runtime using the dl() function

  dl("couchdb.so");

The extension should now be available, you can test this
using the extension_loaded() function:

  if (extension_loaded("couchdb"))
    echo "couchdb loaded :)";
  else
    echo "something is wrong :(";

The extension will also add its own block to the output
of phpinfo();
